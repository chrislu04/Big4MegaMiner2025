## The Basics

ApocaWarlords is a 2-player tile-based turn-based competitive tower defense game. Think of it as a mix between Clash Royale and Bloons TD Battles. Each player has a **Base**, which looks like a castle. The objective of the game is for your **Base** to survive longer than your opponent's ( or equivalently, to DESTROY your opponent's **Base** ).

"How do I survive?" you're probably asking. Well, as this is a tower defense game, you'll be building **Towers** to defend your **Base**. "Defend against what?", you ask? Well, that would be the hired *goons* of your enemy, the **Mercenaries**. ( Don't worry: you can hire *goons* yourself! ) Oh, and you will also be defending against the endless horde of **Demons** which are constantly spawning and becoming progressively stronger, until they completely outscale your available space to place defenses! Look on the bright side though, **Demons** will also be outscaling your enemy.

Defenses and **Mercenaries** don't come cheap, though. You will need to make money by placing a special type of **Tower**, the **House**. If you've ever played Plants vs. Zombies, these are kind of like sunflowers in that game. Be careful not to build too many **Houses**, though. **With each Tower you build, towers of that type will become 25% more expensive**.

## How to Play

ApocaWarlords uses *simultaneous turns*. This means that each turn, both players select their actions at the same time, without communication. After both players select their actions, the game world is updated. This repeats until the game ends.
