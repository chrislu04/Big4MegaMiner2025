Playtesting:
- Try to find edge cases
- Try lots of different maps
- Is the game balanced?

Documentation:
- Intuitive explanation of the game mechanics, with expandable "details" sections
- Explanation of how to run the game, and what the command-line arguments do
- Slides presentation for the event
- Polish up the code, and comment the hell out of it

Visualizer:
- use relative paths in the code, so that it's portable

Backend:
- disqualify contestants when they error out
- demon spawners switch targets?
- demons get stronger/numerous as the game progresses?
- ensure API works smoothly with RL -> give explicit set of choices at each phase
